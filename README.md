# vectordb.py package


`vectordb.py` is a Python library that streamlines vector database operations. It is an in-memory solution, so all vectors and documents are stored in RAM during program execution. This makes it extremely fast and removes the need to run or maintain a persistent vector store (such as Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, etc.).

It offers user-friendly APIs for storing, querying, and managing high-dimensional vectors, making it well-suited for machine learning, information retrieval, and AI-driven search applications.

`vectordb.py` can also be used efficiently for promptflow queries, enabling fast and flexible retrieval in LLM and prompt engineering workflows.

With `vectordb.py`, you can:
- Efficiently store and organize large collections of vector data
- Perform fast similarity searches and retrieve relevant results
- Manage and update vector datasets with ease
- Integrate vector search capabilities into your Python projects
